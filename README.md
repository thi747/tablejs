Matt Kruse's Table.js

Table.js was created by [Matt Kruse](http://www.mattkruse.com). I take almost no credit for this work, well, just a tiny bit for the added stuff.

Decided to resurect this project because it really helped me on what I was doing, although few changes needed to be made, and it seems like it could be so much more.
